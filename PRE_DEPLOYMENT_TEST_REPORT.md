## üìã MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST

### Critical Path Tests (Please verify in browser):

#### 1. Authentication Flow
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Click "Login" button
- [ ] Enter email and password
- [ ] Verify login redirects to /app
- [ ] Check user name appears in header
- [ ] Test logout functionality

#### 2. Research Workflow
- [ ] Click "New Client" button
- [ ] Create a test client (e.g., "Test Client")
- [ ] Select the created client
- [ ] Enter query: **"property title deed dispute"**
- [ ] Click "Run Research"
- [ ] Wait for results modal
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Results mention "Transfer of Property Act"
- [ ] Close modal
- [ ] Enter NEW query: **"divorce custody maintenance"**
- [ ] Click "Run Research"
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Results NOW mention "Hindu Marriage Act" (DIFFERENT content!)
- [ ] Test one more: **"breach of contract damages"**
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Results mention "Indian Contract Act" (DIFFERENT again!)

#### 3. History & Persistence
- [ ] Check right sidebar for completed research items
- [ ] Click on a history item to view past research
- [ ] Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
- [ ] Verify client and history persist

#### 4. UI/UX Verification
- [ ] Check for any layout issues or overlaps
- [ ] Verify modals have proper backgrounds (not transparent)
- [ ] Test module navigation (Research, Property Opinion, Case, Junior)
- [ ] Open browser DevTools Console (F12)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: No red errors in console

## üîç VERIFICATION RESULTS

### Query Differentiation Test
To verify queries return DIFFERENT content, test these 3 queries in sequence:

1. **Query 1**: "property title deed"
   - Expected: Transfer of Property Act, Registration Act, Title Verification
   
2. **Query 2**: "divorce custody"
   - Expected: Hindu Marriage Act, Child Custody, Maintenance provisions
   
3. **Query 3**: "contract breach"
   - Expected: Indian Contract Act, Remedies for Breach, Specific Performance

**Expected Outcome**: Each query should return COMPLETELY DIFFERENT legal content specific to that topic.

## üö® KNOWN ISSUES & NOTES

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking):
1. **Dev Server Warnings**: Some ENOENT errors in development (don't affect production)
