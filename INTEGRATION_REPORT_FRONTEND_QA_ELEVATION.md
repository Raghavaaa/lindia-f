## Pre-Deploy QA Script

A comprehensive pre-deploy script has been created at `qa-automation/pre-deploy-qa.sh` that runs:

1. **Build Verification:** Ensures clean build with no errors
2. **Lint Check:** Validates code quality and standards
3. **Type Check:** Confirms TypeScript compilation
4. **Integration Tests:** Runs full test suite
5. **Accessibility Audit:** Validates WCAG compliance
6. **Performance Check:** Measures bundle size and build time

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x qa-automation/pre-deploy-qa.sh
./qa-automation/pre-deploy-qa.sh
```

## Rollback Plan

In case of deployment issues:

1. **Immediate Rollback:** Switch to backup branch `frontend-qa-backup-20251019_1831`
2. **Configuration Reset:** Revert to working commit `176b37f0585e0ecffe795bd52455e7f773141118`
3. **Environment Check:** Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is correctly set
4. **Health Check:** Run `node trigger-deploy.js` to verify deployment status
